						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article are the 4 key Gestalt principles, which include emergence, reification, multi-stability, invariance, and proximity. These can be applied to UI design, which I thought was interesting as the principles were created long before UI design was a thing. Emergence is where we can see the outlines of things quickly, reification is when we can see things even if they are incomplete, multi-stability is where we see confusing things in multiple ways, and invariance is when we can see simple things regardless of their rotation. These apply to UI design as they can draw emphasis to certain parts of a website along with make the website overall easier to look at.</p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was the example images given after each principle. The dot diagrams were extremely useful in understanding the effect that a certain principle had on the UI. These images were easy to look at and very simple so I was able to fully understand how something affected the website in the eyes of the consumer.</p>
