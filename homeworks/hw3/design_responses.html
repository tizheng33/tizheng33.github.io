						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the importance of font within a website. Previously, I thought you could just choose a font that you thought looked good on a website, but it turns out that a lot more thought goes into choosing a font. For example, you have to consider the audience: what age group is going to your website?  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is where they go over what font size you should choose. I found the golden ratio to be very useful and interesting, as I sometimes struggle to pick a font size. This ratio will make things a lot easier in the future. Also, the Perfect Fourth ratio part was interesting as it relates to something else I'm interested in: music theory. </p>
