						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is that you can be sued for not having a website that is accessible. There are accessibility standards put into place by the United States Access Board and the World Wide Web Consortium. These standards state that a website needs to be accessible if it is related to a federal agency.  </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is where it talks about making the website color accessible. As I have red-green colorblindness, it was nice seeing that website designers make sure that the colors on their website are accessible so anybody can go through them without trouble. In addition, I found the background text to colors part of this section interesting as I didn't know there was an exact ratio that was to be followed. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Also, not creating accessible products is just rude, so donâ€™t be rude." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
