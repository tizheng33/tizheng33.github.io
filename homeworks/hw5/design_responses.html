                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something I learned from this article is that animations and effects on a website make it so much more attractive and easier to look at than just a plain website. These animations are usually colorful and attract attention very easily. I noticed that the scroll effect was pretty common amongst designs, which creates a pretty transition from the normal website to a more detailed website. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article is the top of the article which shows all of the UI interactions in one box. This allowed me to compare all the different designs side by side instead of having to scroll down all the way. In addition, it gave me a preview of all the designs which I thought was nice. I was able to see which ones I wanted to look at specifically before scrolling down to actually see them. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspiration was the easygrow.io app preview because of clean and organized it looked. Everything was extremely accessible, easy on the eyes, and all the information was laid out in front of you. Their interface achieved their goal by having different colors for each vegetable, which was able to highlight the vegetable. It also did this by using a big font size, along with a modern looking font that made the words extremely easy to read. Lastly, they utilized a navigation bar at the bottom that didn't have words, making the app simple to look at.  </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> I would give this article a 9, because it showed me many cool designs that I could try to implement into my Top Dog website midterm. In addition, everything was laid out well and simply. All I had to do was scroll down. </p>
