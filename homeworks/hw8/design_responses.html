						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Something I learned from this article is that there are 11 types of dark patterns on the web; bait and switch, disguised ads, forced continuity, friend spam, hidden costs, misdirection, price comparison prevention, privacy zuckering, roach motel, sneak into basket, and trick questions. These dark patterns have gotten a lot more advanced over the years but aren't only limited to websites. They can also be on things like credit card statements.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article is that they had many different types of dark patterns along with written and visual examples of them. The written examples were cool because they showed the extent of these dark patterns. I liked this because it was relatable; I have seen many of these while browsing the internet.  </p>
