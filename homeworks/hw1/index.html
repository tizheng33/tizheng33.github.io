        <p> Hi, I'm Timothy, a second year intended computer science major at the University of California Berkeley. In my free time, I like to play basketball, cook, watch a movie, listen to music, or go on a hike. I'm from San Francisco. My favorite Berkeley library is Main Stacks.</p>
        <h3>Below are my three favorite restaurants in Berkeley.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Zachary's Chicago Pizza</li>
            <li>Toss Noodle Bar</li>
            <li>Poke Parlor </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Something I learned was that in order to get better at web design, you should study other websites. Specifically, you should pay attention to their content, intent, and hierarchy. </li>
            <li> My favorite part of this article was the different examples of websites, and what the author of this article noticed about them. I liked the Spotify part, as I use Spotify quite frequently but never really analyzed the way the website is designed.</li>
            <li>"You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product."  </li>
            <li>I would give this article a 7 because it's short and gives you valuable information pertaining to web design. </li>
        </ul>
